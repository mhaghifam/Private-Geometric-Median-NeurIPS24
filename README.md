## Abstract

This repository contains the implementation of differentially private (DP) algorithms for computing the geometric median of a dataset. Given $n$ points $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$, our goal is to find a point $\theta$ that minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances to these points while preserving privacy.

Unlike standard approaches like DP-GD that require strong a priori knowledge about data location within a ball of radius $R$ (with excess risk depending linearly on $R$), our algorithms provide excess error guarantees that scale with the **effective diameter** of the datapoints—the unknown radius containing the majority of the data.
